## Log: Create Base Folders

- **Prompt**: (Implicit) Final step in bootstrapping the project.
- **Issue**: None.

### What I did:

I created the fundamental directory structure for the Python package. This organizes the code in a way that is standard for modern Python projects and prepares the workspace for development.

### How I did it:

I used the `mkdir -p` command to create the following directories:

-   `src/learnx_parser/`: This will contain the main source code for the `learnx-parser` package. Using a `src` layout is a best practice that helps prevent import-related issues.
-   `tests/`: This directory will hold all the tests for the package.

### Future work:

Phase 2: Project Bootstrapping is now complete. The project is fully set up and ready for the implementation of the core parsing logic. The next phase is to build a prototype that can parse a single slide.
