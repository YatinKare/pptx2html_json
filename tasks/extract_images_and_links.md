## Log: Extract Images and Links

- **Prompt**: (Implicit) Next task in Phase 3: Single Slide Parser Prototype.
- **Issue**: The sample slide did not contain explicit hyperlinks, requiring a placeholder implementation and a test that asserts no links are found.

### What I did:

I refactored the image extraction into a more general `extract_media` method and added a placeholder for hyperlink extraction. I also introduced a `parse_slide` method to orchestrate the overall slide parsing process.

### How I did it:

1.  **Modified `src/learnx_parser/slide_parser.py`:**
    -   Renamed `extract_images` to `extract_media` to accommodate other media types in the future.
    -   Added a new method `extract_hyperlinks` that searches for `<a:hlinkClick>` elements and resolves their `r:id` using the relationships. For the current sample, this method will return an empty list.
    -   Created a `parse_slide` method that calls `extract_shapes_and_text`, `extract_media`, and `extract_hyperlinks` and returns a dictionary containing all extracted data.

2.  **Modified `tests/test_slide_parser.py`:**
    -   Updated `test_extract_images` to `test_extract_media`.
    -   Added `test_extract_hyperlinks` which asserts that `extract_hyperlinks` returns an empty list for the current sample slide.
    -   Added `test_parse_slide` to verify that the `parse_slide` method returns a dictionary with the expected keys (`shapes`, `media`, `hyperlinks`) and that the extracted data is not empty (for shapes and media) or is empty (for hyperlinks).

### Future work:

With the extraction of shapes, text, images, and a placeholder for links complete, the next step is to implement the `write_html_output` functionality. This will involve taking the structured data extracted by the `SlideParser` and converting it into a clean HTML representation.
