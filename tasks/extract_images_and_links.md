## Log: Extract Images and Links

- **Prompt**: (Implicit) Next task in Phase 3: Single Slide Parser Prototype.
- **Issue**: Initially, image and hyperlink extraction were placeholders or incomplete. The `Slide` dataclass now correctly captures these.

### What I did:

- **Image Extraction and Handling:**
    - `SlideParser` now correctly extracts `Picture` objects, including their `Transform` data (position, size) and `BlipFill` information (path to the image).
    - `PptxParser` now handles the copying of media files (images) from the unpacked PPTX directory to the slide-specific output directories, ensuring that the `image_src` in the generated HTML points to the correct location.
    - Implemented a temporary fix in `SlideParser` to assign default `cx` and `cy` values to `Picture` objects if their `xfrm` element is missing in the XML, ensuring images are visible in the HTML output.

- **Hyperlink Extraction:**
    - `SlideParser` now extracts `Hyperlink` objects, resolving their `r:id` to the actual target URL using the relationships file.
    - `HtmlWriter` now renders hyperlinks as `<a>` tags, using the extracted `r_id` as the `href` attribute.

### How I did it:

1.  **Modified `src/learnx_parser/slide_parser.py`:**
    - Enhanced `_parse_shape_tree` to correctly extract `Transform` data for `Picture` objects.
    - Added logic to extract `BlipFill` data for `Picture` objects.
    - Implemented `extract_hyperlinks` to parse `<a:hlinkClick>` elements and resolve their targets.
    - Ensured `parse_slide` collects and returns `Picture` and `Hyperlink` objects within the `Slide` dataclass.

2.  **Modified `src/learnx_parser/pptx_parser.py`:**
    - Added `_copy_media_for_slide` method to handle copying of image files based on `Picture.blip_fill.path`.
    - Integrated `_copy_media_for_slide` into `parse_presentation` to ensure media is copied for each slide.

3.  **Modified `src/learnx_parser/html_writer.py`:**
    - Updated `write_slide_html` to iterate over `slide.pictures` and render `<img>` tags with correct `src` and `style` attributes.
    - Added logic to render `<a>` tags for `TextRun` objects that have an associated `Hyperlink`.

4.  **Modified `tests/test_pptx_parser.py`:**
    - Updated assertions to check for the existence of media files in the new slide-specific output directories.
    - Adjusted JSON content assertions to reflect that `media` is no longer a top-level key in the JSON output, but rather part of `Picture` objects.

### What was challenging:

- Ensuring correct path resolution for media files across different components (`SlideParser`, `PptxParser`, `HtmlWriter`).
- Debugging the `0x0` image size issue, which led to the discovery of missing `xfrm` data in the sample PPTX and the implementation of a temporary default size.
- Coordinating media copying between `HtmlWriter` (which previously handled it) and `PptxParser` (which now handles it).

### Future work:

- This task is complete. The next step is to update `tasks/json_writer_module.md` to reflect the completed work and then proceed with further integration and testing of the overall `PptxParser` functionality.
