## Log: Write Schema Notes

- **Prompt**: (Implicit) Final step of the planning and grounding phase.
- **Issue**: None.

### What I did:

I synthesized all the information gathered from inspecting the sample `.pptx` file and cross-referencing it with the ECMA-376 standard into a comprehensive `schema_notes.md` document. This file will serve as the foundational technical reference for the project.

### How I did it:

1.  I created a `docs/` directory to store project documentation.
2.  I created a new file, `docs/schema_notes.md`.
3.  I structured the document to cover:
    -   The core file structure of a `.pptx` archive.
    -   A detailed breakdown of the most important XML elements for parsing slide content (`<p:sp>`, `<p:txBody>`, `<a:t>`, `<p:pic>`, `<a:blip>`).
    -   An explanation of how `.rels` files are used to resolve relationships between slides and media.
    -   A high-level workflow for how the parser will operate.

### Future work:

With the planning and grounding phase complete, the project is now ready to move into Phase 2: Project Bootstrapping. The next steps will involve setting up the development environment, initializing the project with `uv`, and creating the necessary folder structure for the Python package.
