## Log: Refactor HtmlWriter - Extract _render_shape_html

### What I did:
1.  Extracted the HTML rendering logic for `Shape` elements from `write_slide_html` into a new private method `_render_shape_html`. The `write_slide_html` method now calls this new helper method when it encounters a `Shape` element.

### How I did it:
1.  Identified the block of code within `write_slide_html` responsible for rendering `Shape` elements.
2.  Moved this code into a new method `_render_shape_html` within the `HtmlWriter` class, which takes a `Shape` object as an argument.
3.  Modified `write_slide_html` to call `self._render_shape_html(element)` when `element` is an instance of `Shape`.
4.  Updated the `slide_data` fixture in `tests/test_html_writer.py` to correctly initialize `SlideParser` with `pptx_unpacked_path`.
5.  Ran existing unit tests (`uv run pytest tests/test_html_writer.py`) to ensure no regressions were introduced.

### What was challenging:
The tests for `html_writer.py` initially failed because the `SlideParser` constructor in the test fixture was missing the `pptx_unpacked_path` argument. This was resolved by adding the argument to the fixture.

### Future work:
Continue refactoring `html_writer.py` by extracting `_render_picture_html`, `_render_group_shape_html`, and `_render_graphic_frame_html` methods. Also, extract styling helper methods like `_get_shape_style_css`, `_get_paragraph_style_css`, and `_get_run_style_css`.
