## Log: Refactor _parse_shape_tree - Extract _parse_shape_element, _parse_picture_element, and _parse_group_shape_element

### What I did:
1.  Extracted the logic for parsing `<p:sp>` elements from `_parse_shape_tree` into a new private method `_parse_shape_element`. The `_parse_shape_tree` method now calls this new helper method when it encounters a `<p:sp>` element.
2.  Extracted the logic for parsing `<p:pic>` elements from `_parse_shape_tree` into a new private method `_parse_picture_element`. The `_parse_shape_tree` method now calls this new helper method when it encounters a `<p:pic>` element.
3.  Extracted the logic for parsing `<p:grpSp>` elements from `_parse_shape_tree` into a new private method `_parse_group_shape_element`. The `_parse_shape_tree` method now calls this new helper method when it encounters a `<p:grpSp>` element.

### How I did it:
1.  Identified the block of code within `_parse_shape_tree` responsible for parsing `<p:sp>` elements.
2.  Moved this code into a new method `_parse_shape_element` within the `SlideParser` class.
3.  Modified `_parse_shape_tree` to call `self._parse_shape_element(child)` and append the returned `Shape` object to the `shapes` list.
4.  Identified the block of code within `_parse_shape_tree` responsible for parsing `<p:pic>` elements.
5.  Moved this code into a new method `_parse_picture_element` within the `SlideParser` class.
6.  Modified `_parse_shape_tree` to call `self._parse_picture_element(child)` and append the returned `Picture` object to the `pictures` list.
7.  Identified the block of code within `_parse_shape_tree` responsible for parsing `<p:grpSp>` elements.
8.  Moved this code into a new method `_parse_group_shape_element` within the `SlideParser` class.
9.  Modified `_parse_shape_tree` to call `self._parse_group_shape_element(child)` and append the returned `GroupShape` object to the `group_shapes` list.
10. Ran existing unit tests (`uv run pytest tests/test_slide_parser.py`) to ensure no regressions were introduced.

### What was challenging:
The initial test run failed due to missing `temp_pptx` directory. I had to manually unpack the `Galaxy presentation.pptx` file into `temp_pptx` using `unzip` before the tests could run successfully.

### Future work:
Continue refactoring `_parse_shape_tree` by extracting `_parse_graphic_frame_element` method.
