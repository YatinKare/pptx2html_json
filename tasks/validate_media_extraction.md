## Log: Validate Media Extraction

- **Prompt**: (Implicit) Next task in Phase 3: Single Slide Parser Prototype.
- **Issue**: The initial test assertion for the `<img>` tag was too strict, including the `style` attribute, which caused a failure.

### What I did:

I enhanced the `HtmlWriter` to correctly handle media files by copying them from the unpacked PPTX directory to the output directory and updating the `src` attributes in the generated HTML. I also updated the tests to verify this functionality.

### How I did it:

1.  **Modified `src/learnx_parser/html_writer.py`:**
    -   Added `pptx_unpacked_path` to the `__init__` method to specify the source of the unpacked PPTX files.
    -   Implemented logic within `write_slide_html` to:
        -   Create a `media` subdirectory within the `output_dir`.
        -   Iterate through the `slide_data["media"]`.
        -   Construct the `original_media_path` using `self.pptx_unpacked_path` and the `media_item["path"]`.
        -   Copy the media file from `original_media_path` to `dest_media_path` using `shutil.copy`.
        -   Adjust the `src` attribute in the `<img>` tag to be relative to the HTML file (e.g., `media/image1.png`).

2.  **Modified `tests/test_html_writer.py`:**
    -   Updated the `html_writer` fixture to pass `os.path.abspath("temp_pptx")` as `pptx_unpacked_path`.
    -   Modified `test_write_slide_html` to:
        -   Assert that the `src` attribute in the `<img>` tag correctly points to the copied media file (e.g., `src="media/image1.png"`).
        -   Assert that the copied media file actually exists in the `test_output/media` directory.

### Future work:

This completes Phase 3: Single Slide Parser Prototype. The next phase is to implement the JSON representation, providing an alternative output format for programmatic use.
