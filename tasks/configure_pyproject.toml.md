## Log: Configure pyproject.toml

- **Prompt**: (Implicit) Next step in bootstrapping the project.
- **Issue**: None.

### What I did:

I configured the `pyproject.toml` file to include essential project metadata, dependencies, and scripts. This file is the heart of the project's packaging and dependency management.

### How I did it:

I edited the `pyproject.toml` file to:

-   Set the project `name` to `learnx-parser`.
-   Add a descriptive `description`.
-   Specify the `license` as MIT.
-   Add author information.
-   Include classifiers to help with PyPI categorization.
-   Add `lxml` to the `dependencies` list. I chose `lxml` because it is a highly performant and feature-rich XML processing library, which will be perfect for parsing the OpenXML format.
-   Define a `test` script under `[tool.uv.scripts]` to allow running tests with `uv run test`.

### Future work:

With the project configuration in place, the next step is to create the actual directory structure for the Python source code and the tests.
