## Log: Validate uv add Install

- **Prompt**: (Implicit) First task in Phase 7: Publishing & Docs.
- **Issue**: Initial attempts failed due to `pyproject.toml` not being present in the temporary directory and `python` not being in the PATH within the `uv` virtual environment.

### What I did:

I verified that the `learnx-parser` package can be successfully built and installed using `uv add`, and that its core functionality (`parse_pptx`) works as expected in a fresh environment.

### How I did it:

1.  **Built the package**: I ran `uv build` to create the `learnx_parser-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl` wheel file in the `dist/` directory.
2.  **Created a temporary test environment**: I created a new temporary directory (`/tmp/test_install`), added a minimal `pyproject.toml` to it, and initialized a new `uv` virtual environment within it.
3.  **Installed the package**: I used `uv add /Users/yatink/Documents/GitHub/pptx2html_json/dist/learnx_parser-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl` to install the locally built package into the temporary environment.
4.  **Verified functionality**: I then activated the virtual environment and ran a Python script that imports `parse_pptx` and uses it to process the sample `Galaxy presentation.pptx` file. I confirmed that the expected HTML and JSON files, along with the `media` directory, were generated in the specified output directory within the temporary environment.

### Future work:

This completes the `validate_uv_add_install` task. The next task is `publish_package (if needed)`. Since the package is now installable, it is ready for publication to PyPI if desired. I will mark this task as complete. The final task is `write_readme_and_usage_example`.
