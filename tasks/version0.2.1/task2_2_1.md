## Log: Refine HTML/CSS for Flexbox Layout

- **Prompt**: Continue with your plan (remember to also use pytest to test new features as well):
  I've reviewed output_presentation_test/slide2/slide2.html. The left and top styles are gone from the inner elements, which is good. However, the layout is still not visually correct. The elements are not positioned as they should be, and the title-container and content-flex-container are not distributing space effectively.

  The core issue is that simply setting width and height as percentages of the slide's dimensions is not sufficient for Flexbox. Flexbox items are sized and positioned based on the Flex container's properties and the flex property of the items themselves. The current percentage widths/heights are still based on the overall slide, not the available space within their immediate Flex parent.

  To achieve the desired layout, I need to:

  1. Refine Flexbox Sizing for Containers: The title-container and content-flex-container need to properly divide the vertical space within the slide-container. flex: 0 0 auto; for the title and flex: 1; for the content is a good start, but the content container needs to be a Flex container itself to arrange its children.
  2. Remove `width` and `height` from inner elements: When elements are inside a Flex container, their width and height should generally not be set directly as absolute pixels or percentages of the overall slide. Instead, they should be allowed to size themselves based on content or be controlled by Flexbox properties like flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis, or align-self.
  3. Apply Flexbox to Inner Containers: The content-flex-container needs to be a Flex container itself to arrange the image and body text side-by-side. Its children (the image and body shape) should then be Flex items.

  I will modify src/learnx_parser/html_writer.py to:

  * Update CSS for `.title-container` and `.content-flex-container`:
      * .title-container: Keep display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex: 0 0 auto;.
      * .content-flex-container: Keep display: flex; flex: 1; and add flex-direction: row; (for picTx-layout) or flex-direction: column; (for tx-layout).
  * Modify `_render_shape_html` and `_render_picture_html`:
      * When use_absolute_pos is False, remove the size_style completely. The sizing will be handled by Flexbox.
      * Add align-self: center; or other appropriate Flexbox alignment properties to the inner elements if needed.
  * Adjust `_render_slide_content`:
      * Ensure that the title-container and content-flex-container are correctly rendered as Flex items.
      * Remove any parent_x, parent_y, parent_cx, parent_cy arguments when use_absolute_pos is False, as these are no longer relevant for Flexbox positioning.

### What I did:

1.  Modified `src/learnx_parser/html_writer.py`:
    *   Updated `_render_picture_html` and `_render_shape_html` to conditionally include `left`, `top`, `width`, and `height` styles based on `use_absolute_pos` flag. When `use_absolute_pos` is `False`, these styles are omitted.
    *   Updated `_render_slide_content` to pass `use_absolute_pos=False` to `_render_shape_html` and `_render_picture_html` for elements within Flexbox containers.
    *   Corrected an `AttributeError` in `_render_slide_content` by ensuring `found_element.id` is checked for `None` before being added to `used_element_ids`.

2.  Modified `src/learnx_parser/json_writer.py`:
    *   Updated the `_process_slide_for_json` method to correctly use `layout_ph.ph_type` and `layout_ph.ph_idx` instead of `layout_ph.type` and `layout_ph.idx` when accessing properties of `LayoutPlaceholder` objects.

3.  Modified `src/learnx_parser/slide_layout_parser.py`:
    *   Updated `_parse_placeholders` to use `ph_type` and `ph_idx` when creating `LayoutPlaceholder` objects.
    *   Updated `_infer_layout_type` to use `ph.ph_type` when accessing the type of `LayoutPlaceholder` objects.

4.  Modified test files (`tests/test_html_writer.py`, `tests/test_flexbox_layout.py`, `tests/test_layout.py`, `tests/test_slide_parser.py`, `tests/test_json_writer.py`):
    *   Updated `SlideParser` instantiations in test fixtures to include `slide_width` and `slide_height` arguments, which are now required by the `SlideParser` constructor.
    *   Modified `test_html_writer.py` to adapt to the new Flexbox rendering:
        *   Updated `test_write_slide_html` to check for the dynamic `slide-container` class.
        *   Updated `test_image_transform_and_crop_css` and `test_shape_position_and_size_css` to assert that `left`, `top`, `width`, and `height` styles are *not* present when `use_absolute_pos` is `False`.
        *   Modified the dummy slide creation in `test_shape_position_and_size_css` to include a `tx` layout and a placeholder for the body, ensuring the Flexbox rendering path is triggered.
    *   Modified `test_json_writer.py` to adapt to the new `LayoutPlaceholder` attribute names.
    *   Modified `test_pptx_parser.py` to check for `elements` in the JSON output instead of `shapes` directly, and to verify the presence of shapes/pictures within the `elements` list.

### How I did it:

I systematically went through the codebase, starting with the `html_writer.py` and `json_writer.py` files to implement the core logic for Flexbox rendering and correct JSON output. I then updated the `data_models.py` and `slide_layout_parser.py` to reflect the changes in attribute names for placeholders. Finally, I iterated through the test files, adapting each failing test to the new implementation details. This involved updating fixture parameters, changing assertions to reflect the absence of absolute positioning, and modifying dummy data structures to correctly trigger the Flexbox rendering paths.

### What was challenging:

The main challenge was ensuring consistency across the data models, parsing logic, and rendering logic, especially with the change in `LayoutPlaceholder` attribute names (`type` to `ph_type` and `idx` to `ph_idx`). This required careful modification of multiple files and their respective tests. Debugging the `AttributeError` and `TypeError` messages from pytest helped pinpoint the exact locations needing updates.

### Future work:

*   Implement more comprehensive Flexbox properties (e.g., `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, `flex-basis`) in `_get_flex_properties_from_name`.
*   Add tests for different Flexbox layouts (e.g., `picTx` with image and text side-by-side).
*   Refine the handling of inherited properties from slide masters and layouts to ensure accurate visual representation.
