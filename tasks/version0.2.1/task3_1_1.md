## Log: Relative Positioning in JSON Output

- **Prompt**: Continue the task by testing the test_json_write.py using uv pytest.
- **Issue**: The `placeholder_container` elements in the JSON output still had absolute positioning, despite the children elements having relative positioning.

### What I did:
1.  Modified `src/learnx_parser/data_models.py` to add `cx` and `cy` attributes to `CommonSlideData` to represent slide dimensions.
2.  Modified `src/learnx_parser/presentation_parser.py` to include a `get_slide_size` method to extract `cx` and `cy` from the presentation XML.
3.  Modified `src/learnx_parser/pptx_parser.py` to pass the slide dimensions (`cx`, `cy`) from `PresentationParser` to `SlideParser`.
4.  Modified `src/learnx_parser/slide_parser.py` to accept `slide_width` and `slide_height` in its constructor and pass them to `CommonSlideData`.
5.  Modified `src/learnx_parser/json_writer.py` to calculate the `transform` of `placeholder_container` elements relative to the `slide_root_transform` (which has `x=0, y=0`).
6.  Updated `tests/test_json_writer.py` to provide dummy `slide_width` and `slide_height` to the `SlideParser` in the test fixture.

### How I did it:
- Used `read_file` to inspect relevant files (`data_models.py`, `presentation_parser.py`, `pptx_parser.py`, `slide_parser.py`, `json_writer.py`, `test_json_writer.py`).
- Used `replace` to modify the code in these files.
- Used `run_shell_command` to run `uv run pytest tests/test_json_writer.py` to verify changes and debug.
- Used `run_shell_command` to run `uv run python main.py` to generate the JSON output for manual inspection.

### What was challenging:
- Tracing the flow of `cx` and `cy` from the presentation XML through various parsers to `CommonSlideData` and finally to `json_writer.py`.
- Ensuring that all `transform` calculations were consistently relative to the correct parent container (element relative to placeholder, placeholder relative to slide root).

### Future work:
- Continue with the remaining tasks in the `version0.2.1/plan.md`, specifically focusing on HTML output and user testing.
