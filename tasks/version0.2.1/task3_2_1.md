## Log: Relative Positioning in JSON Output (Continued)

- **Prompt**: Continue the task by testing the test_json_write.py using uv pytest.
- **Issue**: The `placeholder_container` elements in the JSON output still had absolute positioning, despite the children elements having relative positioning.

### What I did:
1.  Confirmed that `common_slide_data` now correctly includes `cx` and `cy`.
2.  Confirmed that elements within `placeholder_container`s have relative coordinates (x=0, y=0).
3.  Identified that `placeholder_container` elements themselves still had absolute `x` and `y` coordinates.
4.  Modified `src/learnx_parser/json_writer.py` to calculate the `transform` of `placeholder_container` elements relative to the `slide_root_transform` (which has `x=0, y=0`).

### How I did it:
- Used `read_file` to inspect `output_presentation_test/slide2/slide2.json` and `output_presentation_test/slide5/slide5.json`.
- Modified `src/learnx_parser/json_writer.py` to adjust the `transform` calculation for `placeholder_container`.
- Used `run_shell_command` to run `uv run pytest tests/test_json_writer.py` to verify changes and debug.
- Used `run_shell_command` to run `uv run python main.py` to generate the JSON output for manual inspection.

### What was challenging:
- Ensuring that all `transform` calculations were consistently relative to the correct parent container (element relative to placeholder, placeholder relative to slide root).

### Future work:
- Continue with the remaining tasks in the `version0.2.1/plan.md`, specifically focusing on HTML output and user testing.
