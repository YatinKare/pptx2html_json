## Log: Parse Slide XML
- **Prompt**: Implement the `parse_slide_xml` function to parse a single slide's XML structure.
- **Issue**: None

### What I did:
- Reviewed the existing `SlideParser` class in `src/learnx_parser/slide_parser.py`.
- Confirmed that the `SlideParser` class, specifically its `parse_slide` method, along with `extract_shapes_and_text`, `extract_media`, and `extract_hyperlinks` methods, fulfills the requirements for parsing a single slide's XML, extracting shapes, text, images, and links.

### How I did it:
- Analyzed the provided code and cross-referenced it with the task descriptions in `GEMINI.md`.

### What was challenging:
- None.

### Future work:
- Proceed to the next task: `write_html_output`.
