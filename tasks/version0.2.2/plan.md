## Plan: Version 0.2.2 - Refinement and Modularity Improvements

### ðŸ§  Objective
Improve code structure, maintainability, and adherence to project conventions.

### Phase 5: Refinement and Modularity Improvements

*   **Task 5.1: Refactor Existing Code**
    *   **Subtask 5.1.1: Break down large functions**: Identify and refactor overly long or complex functions into smaller, more manageable units.
    *   **Subtask 5.1.2: Improve variable names**: Enhance clarity and readability by using more descriptive variable names where appropriate.
    *   **Subtask 5.1.3: Add comments sparingly**: Add high-value comments to explain complex logic or design decisions, avoiding redundant comments.

*   **Task 5.2: Modularize Components**
    *   **Subtask 5.2.1: Separate parsing logic**: Ensure clear separation of concerns between XML parsing and data model population.
    *   **Subtask 5.2.2: Separate rendering logic**: Ensure clear separation of concerns between data model and HTML/JSON rendering.

*   **Task 5.3: Performance Optimization (If Needed)**
    *   **Subtask 5.3.1: Profile code for bottlenecks**: Use Python's profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks.
    *   **Subtask 5.3.2: Optimize identified bottlenecks**: Implement optimizations for identified performance issues.

*   **Task 5.4: Review and Cleanup**
    *   **Subtask 5.4.1: Remove unused code/imports**: Eliminate dead code and unnecessary imports.
    *   **Subtask 5.4.2: Ensure consistent formatting**: Apply consistent code formatting across the project.
    *   **Subtask 5.4.3: Verify all tests pass**: Run all existing tests to ensure no regressions were introduced.
