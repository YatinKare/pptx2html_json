## Log: Add comments to `html_writer.py`

- **Prompt**: Now I will add high-value comments to `html_writer.py` to explain complex logic, focusing on "why" rather than "what."

### What I did:

Added high-value comments to the `HtmlWriter` class and its methods in `src/learnx_parser/html_writer.py`.

### How I did it:

I went through each method and added comments to explain:
- The purpose of the method.
- The purpose of key variables.
- The logic behind complex operations (e.g., EMU to pixel conversion, gradient CSS generation, transform CSS generation, image cropping, shape styling, paragraph styling, run styling, Flexbox property generation, rendering of graphic frames, group shapes, pictures, shapes, and slide content).
- The overall flow of the `write_slide_html` method.

The comments focus on providing context and explaining *why* certain steps are taken, rather than simply restating *what* the code does. I also ensured that the comments are concise and directly relevant to the code they describe.

After adding comments, I ran `uv run pytest` to verify that the changes did not introduce any regressions. All tests passed successfully.

### What was challenging:

Ensuring that the comments were truly high-value and did not become redundant or overly verbose. It required a balance between providing sufficient explanation and maintaining code readability, especially in methods with intricate CSS generation logic.

### Future work:

Continue with other refactoring tasks outlined in Phase 5 of the project plan, such as ensuring consistent formatting across the project and reviewing for unused code/imports.
