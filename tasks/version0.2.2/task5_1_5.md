## Log: Add comments to `slide_parser.py`

- **Prompt**: I've refactored `parse_slide` in `slide_parser.py` into smaller, more focused functions. Now, I'll add high-value comments to `slide_parser.py` to explain complex logic, focusing on "why" rather than "what."

### What I did:

Added high-value comments to the `SlideParser` class and its methods in `src/learnx_parser/slide_parser.py`.

### How I did it:

I went through each method and added comments to explain:
- The purpose of the method.
- The purpose of key variables.
- The logic behind complex operations (e.g., parsing relationships, extracting common slide data, handling transforms, parsing shape tree, applying inherited transforms).
- The overall flow of the `parse_slide` method.

The comments focus on providing context and explaining *why* certain steps are taken, rather than simply restating *what* the code does. I also ensured that the comments are concise and directly relevant to the code they describe.

After adding comments, I ran `uv run pytest` to verify that the changes did not introduce any regressions. All tests passed successfully.

### What was challenging:

Ensuring that the comments were truly high-value and did not become redundant or overly verbose. It required a balance between providing sufficient explanation and maintaining code readability, especially in methods with intricate XML parsing logic.

### Future work:

Continue with other refactoring tasks outlined in Phase 5 of the project plan, such as ensuring consistent formatting across the project and reviewing for unused code/imports.
