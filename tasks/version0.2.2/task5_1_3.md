## Log: Improve variable names in `pptx_parser.py`

- **Prompt**: Now I will improve variable names in `pptx_parser.py` to enhance clarity and readability.

### What I did:

Improved variable names in the following methods within `src/learnx_parser/pptx_parser.py` to enhance clarity and readability:
- `_copy_media_for_slide`
- `_get_slide_paths_and_rels`
- `_process_single_slide`
- `parse_presentation`

Updated the `__init__` methods of `HtmlWriter` and `JsonWriter` to use `output_directory` as the parameter name, and updated the calls in `PptxParser` and the test files accordingly.

### How I did it:

I went through each of the specified methods and replaced abbreviated or less descriptive variable names with more explicit and understandable ones. For example, `media_output_dir` became `media_output_directory`, `dest_media_path` became `destination_media_path`, `rels_tree` became `relationships_tree`, `presentation_rels` became `presentation_relationships`, `slide_dir` became `slide_directory`, `slide_rels_path` became `slide_relationships_path`, `slide_xml_path` became `slide_xml_file_path`, `slide_rels_path` became `slide_relationships_file_path`, `slide_width` became `slide_presentation_width`, `slide_height` became `slide_presentation_height`, `slide_number` became `current_slide_number`, `slide_parser` became `current_slide_parser`, and `slide_data` became `parsed_slide_data`.

After renaming, I ran `uv run pytest` to verify that the changes did not introduce any regressions. All tests passed successfully.

### What was challenging:

Ensuring consistency across multiple files (PptxParser, HtmlWriter, JsonWriter, and their respective tests) when renaming the `output_dir` parameter to `output_directory` was the main challenge. This required careful attention to detail to avoid `TypeError` issues.

### Future work:

Continue with other refactoring tasks outlined in Phase 5 of the project plan, such as adding comments sparingly and ensuring consistent formatting across the project.
