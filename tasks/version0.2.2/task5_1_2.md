## Log: Improve variable names in `slide_parser.py`

- **Prompt**: I've refactored `parse_slide` in `slide_parser.py` into smaller, more focused functions. Now, I'll improve variable names within `_extract_common_slide_data` to enhance clarity and readability.

### What I did:

Improved variable names in the following methods within `src/learnx_parser/slide_parser.py` to enhance clarity and readability:
- `_extract_common_slide_data`
- `_extract_transform`
- `_extract_fill_properties`
- `_extract_line_properties`
- `_extract_text_frame_properties`
- `_extract_paragraph_properties`
- `_extract_run_properties`
- `_parse_shape_element`
- `_parse_picture_element`
- `_parse_group_shape_element`
- `_parse_graphic_frame_element`
- `_parse_shape_tree`
- `extract_hyperlinks`

Also, added `SlideLayout` to the import list in `slide_parser.py` to resolve `NameError`.

### How I did it:

I went through each of the specified methods and replaced abbreviated or less descriptive variable names with more explicit and understandable ones. For example, `c_sld_elem` became `common_slide_element`, `bg_elem` became `background_element`, `sp_pr` became `shape_properties_element`, and so on. This involved careful search and replace operations to ensure all occurrences were updated correctly.

After renaming, I ran `uv run pytest` to verify that the changes did not introduce any regressions. All tests passed successfully.

### What was challenging:

Ensuring that all instances of the old variable names were replaced, especially in complex nested structures, required careful attention to detail. The `NameError` related to `SlideLayout` was a minor hiccup that was quickly resolved by adding the necessary import.

### Future work:

Continue with other refactoring tasks outlined in Phase 5 of the project plan, such as adding comments sparingly and ensuring consistent formatting across the project.
