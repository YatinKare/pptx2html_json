## Log: Refactor `parse_presentation` in `pptx_parser.py`

- **Prompt**: The `parse_presentation` method in `pptx_parser.py` is quite long and handles multiple responsibilities. I will create a new task to refactor it into smaller, more manageable functions.

### What I did:

Refactored the `parse_presentation` method in `src/learnx_parser/pptx_parser.py` into smaller, more focused functions:
- `_get_slide_paths_and_rels`: This new private method is responsible for parsing `presentation.xml.rels` and resolving the absolute paths for each slide's XML and relationship files. It also handles warnings for unresolved slide IDs or missing files.
- `_process_single_slide`: This new private method encapsulates the logic for parsing a single slide, copying its media files, and writing its HTML and JSON output. It takes the slide's XML path, relationship path, dimensions, and number as arguments.
- `parse_presentation`: The main method now orchestrates the process by calling `_get_slide_paths_and_rels` to get the slide information and then iterates through each slide, calling `_process_single_slide` for each one.

### How I did it:

1.  **Extracted `_get_slide_paths_and_rels`**: Moved the logic for reading `presentation.xml.rels` and resolving slide paths into this new method. This function now returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the absolute path to the slide XML and its corresponding relationship file (or `None` if not found).
2.  **Extracted `_process_single_slide`**: Encapsulated the core logic for processing a single slide (parsing, media copying, HTML/JSON writing) into this method. This improves modularity and readability.
3.  **Updated `parse_presentation`**: Modified the original `parse_presentation` method to use the new helper functions, making it much shorter and easier to understand its high-level flow.
4.  **Verified with tests**: Ran `uv run pytest` to ensure that the refactoring did not introduce any regressions and that all existing tests still pass. All tests passed successfully.

### What was challenging:

Ensuring that all necessary variables and class attributes were correctly passed between the newly created methods and the main `parse_presentation` method. This involved careful consideration of scope and data flow.

### Future work:

Continue with other refactoring tasks outlined in Phase 5 of the project plan, such as improving variable names and adding comments where necessary.
