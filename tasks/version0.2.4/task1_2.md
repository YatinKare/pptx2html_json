# Log: Task 1.2 - Understand Text Parsing Capabilities

**Prompt**: Analyze current text parsing in text.py and examine XML structure for text formatting

**Issue**: Need to understand current text semantic extraction capabilities and identify missing features

## What I did:
1. Analyzed current text parsing implementation in `/src/learnx_parser/parsers/slide/text.py`
2. Examined the XML structure in temp_pptx/ppt/slides/ for text formatting examples
3. Identified current text semantic extraction capabilities
4. Documented missing text semantic features

## How I did it:
- Read the text.py file to understand current parsing logic
- Examined slide XML files to see how text formatting is structured in OpenXML
- Cross-referenced the parsing code with actual XML examples

## Current Text Parsing Capabilities:

### What is Currently Extracted:
1. **Font Size**: `run_properties.font_size` from `a:rPr sz` attribute (lines 167-168)
2. **Bold**: `run_properties.bold` from `a:rPr b="1"` attribute (lines 170-171)
3. **Italic**: `run_properties.italic` from `a:rPr i="1"` attribute (lines 173-174)
4. **Color**: `run_properties.color` from `a:solidFill/a:srgbClr` or scheme colors (lines 176-191)
5. **Font Face**: `run_properties.font_face` from `a:latin typeface` attribute (lines 194-198)
6. **Underline**: `run_properties.underline` from `a:u` element (lines 201-205)

### What is Being Applied in JSON Output:
In the JSON writer (lines 58-67), text formatting is extracted:
- Bold, italic, fontSize, underline properties are captured from first run in paragraph
- These are stored in paragraph_style dictionary
- Applied to bullet-list items when present

### Issues Identified:

1. **Inconsistent Text Formatting Application**: 
   - Only first run properties are used for entire paragraph
   - Mixed formatting within paragraphs is lost
   - Text-box elements don't get style properties applied

2. **Missing Bullet Detection**: 
   - Current bullet detection logic has gaps
   - Agenda slide (slide 2) shows "Topic one\n\tTopic two\nTopic three\nTopic four" as text-box instead of bullet-list
   - Bullet detection relies on explicit bullet elements in XML or level > 0

3. **Layout Detection Issues**:
   - Using PowerPoint internal layout names (`titleOnly`, `picTx`, `titlePic`) instead of semantic names
   - Need mapping to target schema layout names (`title-only`, `title-and-content`, etc.)

## XML Structure Analysis:

From slide23.xml (Agenda slide):
- Each topic is in separate `<a:p>` (paragraph) element
- No explicit bullet properties (`<a:pPr>` elements are minimal)
- Topics appear as regular paragraphs, not bulleted lists
- This explains why they're being treated as text-box content

## What was challenging:
1. Understanding why bullet detection is failing for agenda items
2. Tracing the relationship between XML structure and current parsing logic
3. Identifying where text semantics are being lost in the JSON output pipeline

## Future work:
1. **Phase 2**: Fix bullet-list detection by analyzing paragraph structure and content patterns
2. **Phase 2**: Implement layout mapping from PowerPoint layouts to semantic names
3. **Phase 3**: Ensure text semantics are consistently applied to all element types
4. **Phase 3**: Handle mixed formatting within paragraphs better
5. **Phase 4**: Test with content that has more varied text formatting
