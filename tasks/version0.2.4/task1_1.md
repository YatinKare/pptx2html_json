# Log: Task 1.1 - Understand Current JSON Output Format

**Prompt**: Analyze current JSON writer implementation and compare with target schema

**Issue**: Need to identify gaps between current JSON output and target schema specification

## What I did:
1. Analyzed the current JSON writer implementation in `/src/learnx_parser/writers/json_writer.py`
2. Ran the current implementation on galaxy presentation using `uv run main.py`
3. Examined the output JSON format in `/output_presentation_test/presentation.json`
4. Compared current output structure with target schema from `json_schema.md`

## How I did it:
- Read the json_writer.py file to understand current implementation
- Executed main.py to generate current JSON output
- Analyzed both current and target JSON structures side by side

## Current vs Target Schema Gaps:

### Structure Differences:
1. **Top-level structure**: Current format is mostly correct with `id`, `title`, and `slides` array
2. **Slide layout names**: Current uses PowerPoint internal names (`titleOnly`, `picTx`, `titlePic`) instead of semantic names (`title-only`, `title-and-content`, `title-and-bullets`)
3. **Bullet list detection**: Current implementation sometimes treats bullet points as text-box instead of bullet-list (e.g., slide 2 "Topic one\n\tTopic two\nTopic three\nTopic four" should be bullet-list)
4. **Text semantics**: Current implementation has basic text style parsing but styles are not being applied in the JSON output

### Element Type Issues:
1. Slide 2 should have bullet-list for agenda items but shows as text-box
2. Slide 5 bullet points are shown as text-box instead of bullet-list
3. Layout detection needs improvement for semantic naming

### Text Semantics:
- The code has logic to extract bold, italic, fontSize, and underline from text runs
- Style information is captured but not consistently applied to elements
- Need to verify style extraction is working properly

## What was challenging:
1. Understanding the relationship between PowerPoint's internal layout names and semantic layout names
2. Identifying why bullet point detection is inconsistent
3. Determining which text formatting is being lost in the transformation

## Future work:
1. **Phase 2**: Implement proper layout mapping from PowerPoint layouts to semantic names
2. **Phase 2**: Fix bullet-list detection logic 
3. **Phase 3**: Ensure text semantics (bold, italic, underline, fontSize) are properly extracted and included in JSON output
4. **Phase 3**: Test text semantic extraction with sample content that has formatting
