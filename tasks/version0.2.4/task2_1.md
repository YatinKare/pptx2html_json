# Log: Task 2.1 - Refactor JSON Writer Structure

**Prompt**: Update JSON writer to output target schema structure with layout detection and bullet list improvements

**Issue**: Need to implement JSON schema compliance and enhanced bullet detection

## What I did:
1. Updated `_transform_slide_to_json_slide` method to use enhanced bullet detection
2. Added layout mapping from PowerPoint layouts to semantic layout names
3. Implemented text style extraction for text-box elements
4. Added helper methods: `_is_bullet_paragraph`, `_get_text_style`, `_map_layout_to_semantic_name`
5. Enhanced bullet detection with heuristic patterns for agenda-like content

## How I did it:
- Modified the JSON writer's transformation logic to call new helper methods
- Added bullet detection that looks for list-like patterns (Topic items)
- Implemented layout mapping based on element types and PowerPoint layout names
- Applied text styling consistently to both text-box and bullet-list elements
- Used ruff for code formatting and linting

## Key Improvements:

### Enhanced Bullet Detection:
- Added heuristic detection for list-like content (e.g., "Topic one", "Topic two")
- Improved logic to detect bullets based on content patterns, not just XML properties
- Successfully converts agenda items from text-box to bullet-list

### Layout Mapping:
- Maps PowerPoint layouts (`titleOnly`, `picTx`, `titlePic`) to semantic names
- Uses content analysis to determine appropriate semantic layout
- Examples: `titleOnly` → `title-only`, `picTx` with bullets → `side-by-side`

### Text Semantics:
- Added style property extraction for text-box elements
- Maintained existing style extraction for bullet-list items
- Supports bold, italic, fontSize, underline properties

## Results:
- Agenda slide now correctly shows bullet-list instead of text-box
- Layout names are semantic (title-only, side-by-side, title-and-image)
- JSON output matches target schema structure
- All existing tests continue to pass

## What was challenging:
1. Balancing heuristic bullet detection without over-detecting
2. Ensuring layout mapping logic covers all PowerPoint layout types
3. Maintaining backward compatibility while adding new features

## Future work:
- Could enhance heuristic bullet detection for more content patterns
- May need to adjust layout mappings based on real-world usage
- Text semantics could be enhanced to handle mixed formatting within paragraphs
