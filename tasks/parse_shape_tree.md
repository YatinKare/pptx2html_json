## Log: Refine Slide Element Parsing
- **Prompt**: Accurately parse all relevant PresentationML and DrawingML elements and convert them into a structured, easy-to-use Python object model.
- **Issue**: Current HTML output is visually inaccurate, lacking proper layout, styling, and complete rendering of elements.

### What I did:
- Created this log file for Subtask 1.1.2.
- Modified `src/learnx_parser/slide_parser.py` to implement `_parse_shape_tree` for recursive parsing of `p:sp`, `p:pic`, `p:grpSp`, and `p:graphicFrame` elements.
- Integrated media extraction for pictures directly into `_parse_shape_tree`.
- Updated `parse_slide` to call `_parse_shape_tree` and removed the separate `extract_media` method.
- Removed `slide_layout_path` and `background_color` extraction from `_extract_common_slide_data` as these are inherited properties and will be handled in a later phase.
- Updated `tests/test_slide_parser.py` to reflect these changes and ensure tests pass.
- Attempted to extract `prst_geom` for shapes, but found that the example `slide23.xml` does not explicitly define it for the text shape. Removed the assertion for `prst_geom` from the test for now, as handling default/inherited geometries will be part of a later task.
- Implemented extraction of `a:solidFill` properties within `_parse_shape_tree`.
- Removed the assertion for `fill` data from `tests/test_slide_parser.py` as the example slide does not explicitly define it, and inherited properties will be handled later.
- Implemented extraction of `a:ln` properties within `_parse_shape_tree`.
- Updated the test case to assert that `line` is not in `text_shape` for the "Agenda" shape, as it does not explicitly define a line.
- Implemented extraction of `rot`, `flipH`, and `flipV` from `a:xfrm` within `_parse_shape_tree`. Initialized these with default values in `shape_data` to ensure keys are always present.
- Updated `tests/test_slide_parser.py` to assert the default values for `rot`, `flipH`, and `flipV` for the "Agenda" shape.
- **Completed Subtask 1.2.2: Updated `SlideParser` to use new structures** by refactoring `SlideParser` methods to create and populate instances of the new dataclasses, adjusting return types and variable assignments, and updating test assertions to access properties via dot notation on dataclass instances.
- **Completed Subtask 1.1.4.3: Extracted Placeholder Information (`p:ph`)** by updating the `Shape` dataclass and implementing extraction logic in `_parse_shape_tree`.
- **Completed `blipFill` extraction** within Subtask 1.1.3.2 by updating `Picture` dataclass and `_parse_shape_tree` logic.
- **Completed `gradFill` extraction** within Subtask 1.1.3.2 by updating `GradientFill` dataclass and `_parse_shape_tree` logic.
- **Skipped `pattFill` extraction** within Subtask 1.1.3.2 due to lack of sample data in `temp_pptx`.

### How I did it:
- Followed the `Task Journal Instructions` from `GEMINI.md`.
- Analyzed the `13_PresentationML.txt` and `20_DrawingML_Framework.txt` excerpts to understand the structure of `p:spTree` and its child elements.
- Debugged test failures by inspecting XML and adjusting parsing logic.

### What was challenging:
- Ensuring correct recursive parsing for nested group shapes.
- Integrating media extraction directly into the shape parsing logic.
- Understanding the inheritance model for slide properties (e.g., background color, fills, lines) and deciding to defer their parsing to a later stage for better modularity.
- Correctly identifying and extracting shape geometry, especially when it's not explicitly defined (e.g., default rectangles).
- Shifting focus to core layout properties based on user feedback.
- Migrating from dictionary-based data to a structured dataclass model required careful refactoring across multiple methods.

### Future work:
- **Subtask 1.1.3: Extract Detailed Shape Properties (`p:spPr`)**:
    - **Subtask 1.1.3.1: Geometry (`a:prstGeom`, `a:custGeom`)**: Continue to refine extraction of preset and custom shape geometries. (Initial attempt made, but needs more robust handling of defaults/inheritance).
    - **Subtask 1.1.3.2: Fills (`a:solidFill`, `a:gradFill`, `a:blipFill`, `a:pattFill`)**: Continue to implement extraction of fill types (solid fill, blip fill, and gradient fill implemented, pattern pending) and their properties.
    - **Subtask 1.1.3.3: Lines (`a:ln`)**: Continue to implement extraction of line properties (width, color, dash, cap, join). (Initial implementation done, but needs more comprehensive handling of all line properties).
    - **Subtask 1.1.3.4: Transforms (`a:xfrm`)**: Implement extraction of rotation (`rot`), horizontal flip (`flipH`), and vertical flip (`flipV`) from `a:xfrm`.
- Update `SlideParser` to use new intermediate data structures (Task 1.2).
- Write/update unit tests in `tests/test_slide_parser.py`.
