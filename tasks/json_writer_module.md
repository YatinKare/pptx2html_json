## Log: JSON Writer Module
- **Prompt**: Implement the `json_writer_module` to convert parsed slide data into a JSON representation.
- **Issue**: Initial implementation failed to serialize dataclass objects, leading to `TypeError: Object of type Slide is not JSON serializable`.

### What I did:
- Implemented a custom JSON encoder (`DataclassJSONEncoder`) to handle dataclass serialization.
- Modified `JsonWriter.write_slide_json` to use the custom encoder.
- Ensured JSON output is written to slide-specific subdirectories.

### How I did it:
- Created `DataclassJSONEncoder` inheriting from `json.JSONEncoder`.
- Overrode the `default` method in `DataclassJSONEncoder` to convert dataclass instances to dictionaries using `dataclasses.asdict()`.
- Passed `cls=DataclassJSONEncoder` to `json.dump` in `write_slide_json`.
- Adjusted the output file path in `write_slide_json` to include the slide-specific directory.

### What was challenging:
- Understanding and implementing a custom JSON encoder for dataclasses.
- Ensuring the JSON output structure aligns with the new dataclass model.

### Future work:
- This task is complete. The next step is to proceed with further integration and testing of the overall `PptxParser` functionality.
