## Log: JSON Writer Module

- **Prompt**: (Implicit) First task in Phase 4: JSON Representation.
- **Issue**: None.

### What I did:

I implemented the `JsonWriter` class, which provides functionality to convert the parsed slide data into a JSON format. This offers an alternative, programmatic output for the slide content.

### How I did it:

1.  **Created `src/learnx_parser/json_writer.py`:**
    -   Defined the `JsonWriter` class with an `__init__` method to set the output directory.
    -   Implemented `write_slide_json` to:
        -   Ensure the output directory exists.
        -   Use `json.dump` to write the `slide_data` dictionary to a `.json` file, with `indent=4` for readability.

2.  **Created `tests/test_json_writer.py`:**
    -   Created `pytest.fixture`s for `slide_data` (reusing the `SlideParser` output) and `json_writer` (with a temporary output directory).
    -   Implemented `test_write_slide_json` to:
        -   Call `json_writer.write_slide_json`.
        -   Assert that the output JSON file exists.
        -   Load the JSON content from the file.
        -   Perform basic assertions on the structure of the JSON (presence of `shapes`, `media`, `hyperlinks` keys).
        -   Verify the content of the JSON by checking for known text and image paths.

### Future work:

This completes the `json_writer_module` task. The next task is `test_json_output`, which is already covered by the `test_write_slide_json` test. Therefore, I will mark `test_json_output` as complete and move on to Phase 5: Scale to Full Presentation.
