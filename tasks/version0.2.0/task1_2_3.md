# Task 1.2.3: Modify `_render_picture_html` to accept `parent_x` and `parent_y` and calculate relative positions

**Status:** Completed

**Description:**
Updated the `_render_picture_html` method in `src/learnx_parser/html_writer.py` to accept `parent_x` and `parent_y` arguments. The `left` and `top` CSS properties for pictures are now calculated relative to these parent coordinates, allowing for correct positioning within nested HTML structures.
