# Task 1.1.1: Add `_render_slide_content(self, slide: Slide)` method to `html_writer.py`

**Status:** Completed

**Description:**
Added a new method `_render_slide_content` to the `HtmlWriter` class in `src/learnx_parser/html_writer.py`. This method is intended to encapsulate the logic for inferring slide layouts and generating structured HTML content based on the arrangement of elements on a slide.
