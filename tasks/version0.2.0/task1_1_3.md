# Task 1.1.3: Modify `write_slide_html` to call `_render_slide_content`

**Status:** Completed

**Description:**
Modified the `write_slide_html` method in `src/learnx_parser/html_writer.py` to delegate the content rendering to the newly introduced `_render_slide_content` method. This ensures that the layout inference logic is applied when generating the HTML for each slide.
