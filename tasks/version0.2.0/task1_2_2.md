# Task 1.2.2: Modify `_render_group_shape_html` to accept `parent_x` and `parent_y` and calculate relative positions, and pass parent coordinates to its children

**Status:** Completed

**Description:**
Updated the `_render_group_shape_html` method in `src/learnx_parser/html_writer.py` to accept `parent_x` and `parent_y` arguments. The `left` and `top` CSS properties for group shapes are now calculated relative to these parent coordinates. Crucially, this method now passes its own absolute `x` and `y` coordinates (`element.transform.x`, `element.transform.y`) as `parent_x` and `parent_y` to its children's rendering functions, ensuring correct nested relative positioning.
