# Task 1.3.2: Fix `TypeError` in `tests/test_json_writer.py` by providing `pptx_unpacked_path` to `SlideParser`

**Status:** Completed

**Description:**
Corrected the `TypeError` in `tests/test_json_writer.py` by ensuring that the `SlideParser` constructor is provided with the `pptx_unpacked_path` argument. This resolves the issue where the parser was initialized with missing arguments.
