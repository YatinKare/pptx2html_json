## Log: Final Review and User Testing (HTML)

- **Prompt**: Generate HTML for `example/Galaxy presentation.pptx` and review `slide2.html` for correct layout.
- **Issue**: Initial HTML output did not reflect the inferred layout.

### What I did:
1.  Ensured `main.py` was configured to output to `output_presentation_test`.
2.  Ran `uv run python main.py` to generate the HTML output.
3.  Reviewed `output_presentation_test/slide2/slide2.html`.

### How I did it:
- Used `run_shell_command` to execute `main.py`.
- Used `read_file` to inspect the generated `slide2.html`.
- Manually verified the HTML structure for the presence of `flex-row-container` and the relative positioning of its child elements (image and text).

### What was challenging:
- Ensuring the correct `main.py` and output directory were being used due to previous caching and execution path issues.

### Future work:
- Proceed with the remaining tasks in the `version0.2.0/plan.md`.
- Consider implementing automated visual regression tests for HTML output in future versions.
