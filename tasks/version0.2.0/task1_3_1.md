# Task 1.3.1: Add a new test case `test_nested_flexbox_layout_html_output` in `tests/test_flexbox_layout.py` to validate nested element rendering and relative positioning

**Status:** Completed

**Description:**
Added a new test method `test_nested_flexbox_layout_html_output` to `tests/test_flexbox_layout.py`. This test creates a dummy `GroupShape` with nested `Picture` and `Shape` elements, simulating a flexbox container. It then asserts that the `HtmlWriter` correctly generates HTML with the group shape positioned absolutely and its children positioned relatively within the group, along with the appropriate flexbox CSS.
