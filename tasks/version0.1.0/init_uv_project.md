## Log: Initialize uv Project

- **Prompt**: (Implicit) Start of Phase 2: Project Bootstrapping.
- **Issue**: None.

### What I did:

I initialized a `uv` project to create a virtual environment for this package. This is the first step in setting up a clean, reproducible development environment.

### How I did it:

I ran the command `uv venv`. This command automatically creates a `.venv` directory containing the Python interpreter and necessary scripts.

### Future work:

With the virtual environment in place, the next step is to configure the `pyproject.toml` file to define project metadata and dependencies. I will also create the basic directory structure for the source code and tests.
