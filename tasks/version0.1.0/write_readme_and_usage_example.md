## Log: Write README and Usage Example

- **Prompt**: (Implicit) Final task in Phase 7: Publishing & Docs.
- **Issue**: The `README.md` file was empty.

### What I did:

I created a comprehensive `README.md` file for the project. This document serves as the primary source of information for users and developers, covering the package's features, installation instructions, usage examples, and development guidelines.

### How I did it:

I wrote the `README.md` file, including the following sections:

-   **Features**: A high-level overview of what the `learnx-parser` can do.
-   **Installation**: Clear instructions on how to install the package using `uv add`.
-   **Usage**: A Python code example demonstrating how to use the `parse_pptx` function to convert a `.pptx` file.
-   **Development**: Instructions for setting up the development environment, running tests, and building the package.
-   **Project Structure**: An overview of the key directories and files in the project.
-   **License**: A reference to the project's license.

### Future work:

This completes all the defined tasks in the project plan. The `learnx-parser` is now a functional, tested, and documented Python package capable of parsing `.pptx` files and converting them to HTML and JSON. Further enhancements could include handling more complex styling, animations, and interactive elements, as well as supporting multilingual text more robustly.
