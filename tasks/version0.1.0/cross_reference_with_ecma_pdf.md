## Log: Cross-Reference with ECMA PDF

- **Prompt**: User provided the ECMA-376 specification.
- **Issue**: None.

### What I did:

I correlated my findings from the sample `.pptx` file with the official ECMA-376 standard to ensure my understanding of the key XML tags is accurate. This step is crucial for building a reliable parser.

### How I did it:

I reviewed the provided ECMA-376 Part 1 specification, focusing on the definitions and hierarchies of the PresentationML (`p:`) and DrawingML (`a:`) schemas. I matched the tags I observed in the unpacked XML files with their formal definitions.

### Key Tag Correlations:

-   **`<p:sp>` (Shape):** Confirmed as the primary container for slide content. The specification details its extensive properties for positioning, styling, and geometry.
-   **`<p:txBody>` (Text Body):** Verified as the element that holds text within a shape. The standard explains its relationship with text styles and levels.
-   **`<a:t>` (Text Run):** Confirmed as the element containing the actual text. The spec clarifies how multiple runs can exist within a single paragraph (`<a:p>`) to apply different formatting.
-   **`<p:pic>` (Picture):** Verified as the element for embedded images.
-   **`<a:blip>` (Binary Large Image or Picture):** Confirmed as the element that links to the media file via an `r:embed` relationship ID. The standard details how this fits within the picture's fill properties.

### Future work:

My understanding of the core XML schema is now grounded in both a practical example and the official specification. I am ready to synthesize this information into the `schema_notes.md` document, which will serve as the primary reference for the coding phase.
