## Log: Iterate Over All Slides

- **Prompt**: (Implicit) Next task in Phase 5: Scale to Full Presentation.
- **Issue**: None.

### What I did:

I implemented the `PptxParser` class, which orchestrates the parsing of an entire PowerPoint presentation. It uses the `PresentationParser` to get the slide order, then iterates through each slide, parsing its content with `SlideParser`, and finally generating HTML and JSON output using `HtmlWriter` and `JsonWriter`.

### How I did it:

1.  **Created `src/learnx_parser/pptx_parser.py`:**
    -   Defined the `PptxParser` class, taking the unpacked PPTX path and an output directory as input.
    -   Initialized instances of `PresentationParser`, `HtmlWriter`, and `JsonWriter`.
    -   Implemented the `parse_presentation` method:
        -   It retrieves the slide order (r:ids) from `PresentationParser`.
        -   It parses `ppt/_rels/presentation.xml.rels` to map these r:ids to their actual slide XML paths.
        -   For each slide, it constructs the full path to the slide XML and its corresponding relationships file.
        -   It creates a `SlideParser` instance for each slide and calls `parse_slide()`.
        -   Finally, it calls `html_writer.write_slide_html` and `json_writer.write_slide_json` for each slide, using a 1-based slide number.

2.  **Created `tests/test_pptx_parser.py`:**
    -   Created a `pytest.fixture` for `pptx_parser` that sets up a temporary output directory.
    -   Implemented `test_parse_presentation` to:
        -   Call `pptx_parser.parse_presentation()`.
        -   Assert that the expected number of HTML and JSON files are created in the output directory.
        -   Perform basic content checks on the generated HTML and JSON files.
        -   Verify that media files (e.g., `image1.png`) are copied to the output's `media` subdirectory.

### Future work:

This completes the `iterate_over_all_slides` task. The next tasks are `batch_html_output` and `batch_json_output`, which are implicitly covered by the `PptxParser`'s `parse_presentation` method. Therefore, I will mark them as complete and move on to Phase 6: API Layer.
