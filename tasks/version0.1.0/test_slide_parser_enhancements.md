## Log: Test Slide Parser Enhancements
- **Prompt**: Write unit tests for the enhanced `SlideParser` methods, specifically `_extract_common_slide_data` and `_parse_shape_tree`.
- **Issue**: Lack of comprehensive testing for recent parsing enhancements.

### What I did:
- Created this log file.
- Will now proceed to implement unit tests for the `SlideParser` class's new functionalities.

### How I did it:
- Followed the `Task Journal Instructions` from `GEMINI.md`.

### What was challenging:
- None yet.

### Future work:
- Implement unit tests in `tests/test_slide_parser.py` to verify:
    - Correct extraction of `slide_layout_path` and `background_color`.
    - Accurate parsing of `p:sp`, `p:pic`, `p:grpSp`, and `p:graphicFrame` elements.
    - Correct extraction of `x`, `y`, `cx`, `cy` for all shape types.
    - Proper handling of nested group shapes.
    - Correct media path extraction for pictures.
