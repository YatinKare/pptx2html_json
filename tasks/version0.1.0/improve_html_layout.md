## Log: Improve HTML Layout and Z-index
- **Prompt**: Text is hidden by images; consider using flexbox and relative positioning for better layout.
- **Issue**: Generated HTML does not correctly handle z-index, leading to text being obscured by images. Current absolute positioning might not be ideal for complex layouts.

### What I did:
- Acknowledged the issue and the suggestion.
- Created this task to track the improvement.

### How I did it:
- Identified the problem based on user feedback and visual inspection of generated HTML.
- Recognized the potential benefits of using more flexible CSS layout models (e.g., flexbox, grid) and relative positioning for better z-index control and overall layout fidelity.

### What was challenging:
- This is a new task, so no challenges encountered yet.

### Future work:
- Investigate and implement a more robust CSS layout strategy (e.g., flexbox, CSS Grid) to better mimic PowerPoint's relative positioning and z-order.
- Ensure proper z-index handling to prevent elements from obscuring others unintentionally.
- Evaluate the feasibility of dynamic layout adjustments based on content.
