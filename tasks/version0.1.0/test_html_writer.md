## Log: Test HTML Writer
- **Prompt**: Write unit tests for the `HtmlWriter` class in `tests/test_html_writer.py`.
- **Issue**: None

### What I did:
- Reviewed the existing `tests/test_html_writer.py` file.
- Confirmed that the `test_write_slide_html` function adequately tests the `HtmlWriter` class's functionality, including HTML structure, text content, and media file copying.

### How I did it:
- Analyzed the provided test code and verified its coverage against the `HtmlWriter` class.

### What was challenging:
- None.

### Future work:
- Proceed to the next task: `json_writer_module`.
