## Log: Test JSON Output
- **Prompt**: Write unit tests for the `JsonWriter` class in `tests/test_json_writer.py`.
- **Issue**: None

### What I did:
- Reviewed the existing `tests/test_json_writer.py` file.
- Confirmed that the `test_write_slide_json` function adequately tests the `JsonWriter` class's functionality, including JSON content and data points.

### How I did it:
- Analyzed the provided test code and verified its coverage against the `JsonWriter` class.

### What was challenging:
- None.

### Future work:
- Proceed to the next task: `parse_presentation_order`.
