## Log: Write HTML Output
- **Prompt**: Implement the `write_html_output` function to convert parsed slide data into an HTML representation.
- **Issue**: Initial implementation had visual inaccuracies due to insufficient parsing of detailed visual properties and incorrect handling of dataclass structures.

### What I did:
- Refactored `HtmlWriter` (`src/learnx_parser/html_writer.py`) to accept and correctly process the new dataclass structure (`Slide`, `Shape`, `Picture`, `TextFrame`, `Paragraph`, `TextRun`, `Transform`, `SolidFill`, `GradientFill`, `Line`, `RunProperties`, `ParagraphProperties`).
- Implemented rendering logic for `Transform` (position, size), `SolidFill`, `GradientFill`, and `Line` properties for shapes.
- Enhanced text rendering to correctly apply `ParagraphProperties` (alignment, indent) and `RunProperties` (font size, bold, italic, underline, color, font face).
- Updated the media handling to correctly reference image paths relative to the slide's output directory.
- Ensured the output HTML and media files are organized into slide-specific subdirectories as per `GEMINI.md`.

### How I did it:
- Modified the `write_slide_html` method to iterate through `slide.shapes` and `slide.pictures`.
- Used `_emu_to_px` for accurate unit conversion.
- Implemented `_get_gradient_css` to generate CSS for gradient fills.
- Iteratively debugged and fixed `SyntaxError` (unmatched curly brace), `AttributeError` (incorrect dataclass attribute access like `algn` vs `align`, `runs` vs `text_runs`, `solid_fill` vs `fill`), and `AssertionError` (missing text content and image files) by inspecting generated HTML and `slide_data`.
- Removed media copying logic from `HtmlWriter`, delegating it to `PptxParser`.

### What was challenging:
- Adapting the HTML generation to the new, deeply nested dataclass structure required careful traversal and conditional rendering logic.
- Debugging subtle errors related to attribute names and data access within dataclasses.
- Ensuring correct relative paths for media files in the generated HTML.

### Future work:
- This task is complete. The next step is to update `tasks/extract_images_and_links.md` and `tasks/json_writer_module.md` to reflect the completed work and then proceed with further integration and testing of the overall `PptxParser` functionality.
