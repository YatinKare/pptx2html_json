## Project Charter: LearnX PowerPoint Parser

### üß† Objective

Build a robust, fully-tested, importable Python package that:
- Parses `.pptx` files by manually reading the OpenXML structure
- Converts slides to cleanly structured HTML or JSON per slide
- Extracts and references media files (images, audio) with renamed, organized folders
- Preserves layout, text position, styling, and supports multilingual text
- Is installable via `uv add` and suitable for PyPI publication
- Will be used as a module in a larger application (not as a full app)

## üìã Gemini Project Workflow Overview
You and the user will be making multiple versions of this package/tool that constantly improves over time. First some terminology:

- Version: A fully running usable package that has no errors and has been tested thoroughly.
- Phase: Part of a version where different stages are used to achieve a feature or group of features for the version.
- Task: Part of a Phase to achieve either planning/reading a section of documentation or code to get a better understanding or writing code using the specified task workflow defined later.
- Subtask: Part of a task that is very simplistic and easily obtainable, even a junior dev could do it. 

For each new version it will look like this:

1. User prompts the issues from their testing/the last version.
2. You create a new version{{version_number}} folder in the tasks/ folder.
   - 2.1 Create a new plan.md in that version folder. It should have Phases. Each phase will have 2-5 tasks. And each task will have 2-10 subtasks.:
      - 2.1.1 Phase 1: Planning and understanding the XML documentation.
         - `docs/` is where there is llm generated documentation for a high level understanding. **you will NOT assume anything about the documentation**. When you are parsing documentation, don't look for specific tags like `<example:xmltag>` instead you should be looking for keywords that relate to the specific search. If it is not specified in the docs, you should also look on the web. Either way, after you have identified the specific documentation you should ALWAYS cross reference it in the temp_pptx directory which is the decompiled example/galaxy_presentation.pptx file.
         - You will understand and if needed create documentation in `docs/` for yourself for each non-correlated task.
      - 2.1.2 Phase 2-(N-1): Achieving the Goal.
         - There can be how many ever phases needed.
      - 2.1.3 Phase N: Testing and Validation:
         - This is **NOT** pytest. This is user testing where you will actually use `main.py` to simulate what it would look like to use the package.
         - The user will provide feedback in terms of screenshots.
         - The project must be buildable.

### Phase Workflow
1. Read the subtasks
2. Start Coding. Always double check that you haven't deleted or changed more code than you meant to.
3. Test using the uv pytest combination.
4. Debug the testing
5. After successful testing has been achieved, go to next subtask
6. After all subtasks are sucessful write a NEW log report (specified below)
7. commit your changes using git.
8. go to next task.
9. When you are done with the task, make sure everything is committed and push to GitHub.


## üì¶ Tooling Rules

- Use only `uv` CLI commands:
  - ‚úÖ `uv venv`, `uv pip install`, `uv run`, `uv add`, `uv test`
  - ‚ùå Never run `python main.py`, `pip install`, `pytest`, etc.
- Maintain all dependencies and scripts in `pyproject.toml`

## üìì Task Journal Instructions

This is to track our progress. You should **NEVER** updated your task journal it is a READ ONLY file. 
At the end of every task (whether code or planning), update:

```
tasks/<task_name>_<task_number>.md
```

### Template:
```
## Log: <task title>
- **Prompt**: <prompt you received>
- **Issue**: <issue or ambiguity>

### What I did:
...

### How I did it:
...

### What was challenging:
...

### Future work:
...
```

## Summary

Gemini, your job is to reason, research, and execute like a full-stack engineer. This includes documentation, planning, reflection, and improvement ‚Äî not just outputting code.

Do not proceed to code until:
- ‚úÖ The XML schema has been analyzed and documented
- ‚úÖ Your understanding is grounded in both the sample `.pptx` and ECMA PDF

You're not just building a parser ‚Äî you're building infrastructure.

Good luck.

## üß† Example Project Workflow (Addressing Visual Inaccuracies)

### **Phase 1: Enhanced XML Parsing & Intermediate Representation**
